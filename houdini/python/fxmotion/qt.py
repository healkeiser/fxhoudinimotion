"""Qt binding for the panel, through qtpy.

Houdini 19.5 and older ship PySide2, 20 and newer ship PySide6. qtpy hides that,
so the panel does not name a binding anywhere. It is not part of Houdini, so the
setup guide installs it into vendor/, which the package file appends to
PYTHONPATH.

The fallback below is a safety net for someone who installed the HDA without
that step, not a supported path: it picks whatever binding Houdini happens to
ship. Importing Qt in one place also gives any future compatibility shim a
single seam to live in.

Imports are only half of supporting both bindings. The two helpers below cover
the calls that are actually spelled differently, so nothing else in the panel
names a Qt version.
