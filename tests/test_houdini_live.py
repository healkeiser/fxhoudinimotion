"""Live-session test: drive the real panel widgets inside a running Houdini.

Run INSIDE Houdini (Python Shell or the MCP bridge), not hython: it needs hou.ui
and a real Qt application.

    exec(open("tests/test_houdini_live.py").read()); print("\n".join(run()))

SCOPE, honestly stated. These assert the hygiene properties we can measure: that
the segment dialog is never modal, that dialogs and menus do not accumulate,
that nothing waits on a nested event loop, that no Qt grab or modal widget is
left behind.

They still do NOT prove the "Houdini panes stop answering the mouse" wedge is
gone. We now know exactly what that wedge is: after a nested Qt event loop runs
inside Houdini's UI pump, every NATIVE mouse message is delivered to Houdini's
panes twice, so their press/release pairing never rebalances. Traced event by
event with scripts/diagnose_input_wedge.py. But only a native message doubles; a
synthetic one sent with sendEvent arrives exactly once, measured. So no test can
generate the condition, and a human still has to click a Houdini pane to
confirm. Use trace() in that script.
