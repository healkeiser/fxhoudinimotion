"""Guards for the panel rules that were learned the hard way, in a real Houdini
session.

Each rule here corresponds to a bug that actually shipped and locked Houdini's
panes out of the mouse, or broke the panel outright. They are cheap source
checks, no Houdini and no Qt required, so they run anywhere:

    python tests/test_panel_conventions.py

They do not replace the live-session test (tests/test_houdini_live.py), which
drives the real widgets. They catch the same mistakes far earlier and for free.
