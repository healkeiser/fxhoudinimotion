# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time. This is a bridge between two moving parts, NVIDIA Kimodo and
Houdini, so most of what follows is about which half a change belongs in and how to test
it without a GPU farm.

## Where a change belongs

Three projects sit in a line, and a bug usually belongs to exactly one of them:

| Symptom | Where it goes |
| --- | --- |
| The motion itself is wrong, drifts, or ignores the prompt | [nv-tlabs/kimodo](https://github.com/nv-tlabs/kimodo), not here |
| The server does not start, or `/generate` returns the wrong thing | here, `server/` (`fxmotion_server.py`, `kimodo_backend.py`, `kimodo_adapter.py`) |
| The node, the panel, the skinning or the transforms | here, `houdini/python/fxmotion/` or `scripts/build_hda.py` |
| The containers do not come up | here, `docker-compose.bridge.yaml` |

If you are not sure, open an issue and say what you observed. Guessing wrong costs
nothing.

## Getting set up

The full walkthrough is [docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md); the short version is in the
README under [Installation](README.md#installation). You need both halves running before
you can test most changes:

```shell
docker compose -f docker-compose.bridge.yaml up text-encoder -d   # wait for "healthy"
MOCK_MODE=0 docker compose -f docker-compose.bridge.yaml up api -d
curl http://localhost:8001/health     # {"status":"ok","mock_mode":false}
```

`MOCK_MODE=1` serves a canned `dev_reference.npz` instead of running inference. Use it for
anything that is not the model itself: it needs no GPU, starts in seconds, and is the only
sane way to iterate on the panel or the node interface.

Do not `pip install` into Houdini's Python or your user site-packages. The one dependency
that does not ship with Houdini is QtPy, and it goes in `vendor/`, which the package file
puts on `PYTHONPATH`:

```shell
python -m pip install --target vendor --no-deps QtPy
```

## The HDA is generated

This is the rule that costs the most time when missed. `scripts/build_hda.py` is the
single source of the node interface; every callback and cook inside the asset is a
one-line call into `houdini/python/fxmotion/nodes/`, where the logic lives and is
tested. `houdini/otls/vb_kimodo_motion_2.0.hda/` is the expanded, reviewable result.
`vb_kimodo_motion_1.1.hda/` next to it is frozen: old scenes load it, nothing edits it.

**Anything you change in Type Properties by hand is overwritten on the next rebuild.**
Fold it into the script instead, then regenerate:

```shell
hython scripts/build_skin.py     # embedded skin mesh + A-pose skeleton, needs kimodo cloned alongside
hython scripts/build_hda.py      # the HDA, help card included, expanded into houdini/otls/
```

Commit the expanded `houdini/otls/` tree; it is what a reviewer can actually read.

`.gitattributes` forces LF inside `houdini/otls/` and marks the gzipped section binary. If
your editor or a script rewrites those line endings, `hotl` cannot repack the HDA. Do not
"fix" the line endings.

## Tests

Two of the three need neither Houdini nor a GPU, so there is no excuse for skipping them.
Either run them as plain scripts, which needs nothing installed:

```shell
python tests/test_timeline_model.py     # pure-python timeline model
python tests/test_panel_conventions.py  # source-level guards, see below
```

or under pytest, which is what CI runs. `pyproject.toml` excludes the live test from
collection, so `pytest` on its own is the whole runnable suite:

```shell
pytest -q
```

The third drives the real widgets and has to run inside a running Houdini, not `hython`,
because it needs `hou.ui` and a real Qt application:

```python
exec(open("tests/test_houdini_live.py").read()); print("\n".join(run()))
```

Run the live test for any change under `houdini/python/fxmotion/`. It states its own
limits honestly at the top of the file: it proves the hygiene properties it can measure,
and it does not prove the pane-wedge bug is gone, because no reliable programmatic
detector for that was ever found. Clicking a Houdini pane afterwards is still part of the
job.

## The panel rules

`tests/test_panel_conventions.py` is not style policing. Every rule in it corresponds to a
bug that actually shipped and locked Houdini's panes out of the mouse. The recurring cause
is re-entering Houdini from inside a Qt handler: calling `QDialog.exec`, opening a dialog
from a mouse handler, or running work from a click handler rather than from the event
loop.

If that test fails, do not work around it. Read the rule it names and the commit it came
from.

## Style

- **ASCII only** in code, comments, log strings and commit messages. No smart quotes, no
  em dashes, no arrows. They break in Houdini's console and in the HDA sections.
- Match the file you are editing: its comment density, its naming, its idiom.
- Comments explain why, not what. The repo leans heavily on this, and it is why the
  reasoning behind an odd-looking workaround usually sits right above it.
- Say "segment", never "sequence". One concept, one word.
- `ruff check .` and `ruff format --check .` must both pass; CI runs them, on the ruff
  version pinned in `.github/workflows/tests.yml`. The config is in `pyproject.toml`: 80
  columns, and the rules that would only restyle working code are switched off there, so
  anything the linter does report is worth reading.
- `scripts/_soma77.py` is excluded from the formatter on purpose. Its row grouping is the
  data, and it is embedded verbatim as the HDA's PythonModule section, so reflowing it
  would mean regenerating the HDA for nothing.

## Commits

[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

Types in use here: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `build`, `chore`.
Scopes in use: `hda`, `panel`, `server`, `compose`, `docs`, `tools`, or several separated
by commas when a change genuinely spans them (`fix(hda,panel):`). Append `!` for a
breaking change, as in `feat(hda)!:`.

Write a body when the change is not obvious from the subject. The history is deliberately
verbose about *why* a fix works, including the approaches that did not, so the next person
does not retry them.

## Pull requests

- Branch from `main`.
- Keep it to one concern. A rename and a bug fix in the same PR is two PRs.
- Say how you tested it. "Generated a 3-segment clip in Houdini 20.5, encoder on CPU" is
  worth more than a green checkmark.
- If you touched the HDA, confirm you regenerated it rather than editing Type Properties.

## Licensing of contributions

This repository is split across two sets of terms, and which one your contribution lands
under depends on the file you touched. [LICENSE](LICENSE) has the exact list.

- Touching the panel, the tests, the packaging or this file? That is the **MIT** half, and
  your contribution ships under MIT.
- Touching `server/`, the node code ported from the 1.1 asset, the generated HDAs or the
  upstream docs ([LICENSE](LICENSE) has the full list)? Those are derived from
  [chordee/kimodo-houdini-bridge](https://github.com/chordee/kimodo-houdini-bridge) and
  carry its terms, personal and research use. Your additions there are offered under MIT
  to the extent they are separable, which is what keeps a future relicensing possible if
  upstream ever agrees to one.

By contributing you agree to that split. The model weights are separate again and bind
users regardless: [NVIDIA Open Model License](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/agreements/enterprise-software/nvidia-open-model-license)
for the Kimodo weights, Llama 3 Community License for the text encoder's base weights.
